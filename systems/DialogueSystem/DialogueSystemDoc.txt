Store all json files in a folder named "DialogueData"
Name any character portraits "characters name" + "emotion" and save as a png in the DialogueData folder (ex "BobHappy").
The "DialogueData" folder should be at the top of the resource directory.
Dialogue can be broken into "phrases" with the character name, text and emotion if portraits are being used (BBcode can be used for text)

ex:
Name: Bob
Text: Hello World!
Emotion: Happy

Name: Fred
Text: Interesting text.
Emotion: Neutral
